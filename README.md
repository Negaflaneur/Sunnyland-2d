# Sunnyland

A 2D pixel art platformer built on Unity engine 

## Description

This is my first game built on Unity. A seemingly sunny and peaceful world can sometimes conceal insidious mysteries in its shadows. You, as the main character, have a chance to explore 4 levels packed with interactive game play and multiple enemies. On the last level you encounter the gatekeeper who might just have all the keys you need.
